# ThirdParty Bundles

As of this writing, Mautic doesn't seem to have a published way for plugins to
include dependencies (see https://www.mautic.org/community/index.php/4898-about-plugin-dependencies/0).

As a hack to get around this limitation, we include the source of the bundles
here.  We've updated the namespacing in the source code to use our plugin's
namespace as a base in order to prevent conflicts, etc.
